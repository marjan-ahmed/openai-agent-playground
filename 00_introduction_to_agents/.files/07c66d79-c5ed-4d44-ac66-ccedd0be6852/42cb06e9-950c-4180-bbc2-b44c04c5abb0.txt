Write an essay about your favourite teacher. In your essay, describe
- the appearance or personality of the teacher.
- any ONE reason why the teacher is your favourite.
- a situation with your teacher that left a lasting impact on your life.


A teacher is a spiritual mother of a person, who guide their student students on the right track. Just like mother, who takes care and always thinks about her children's future. A teacher is always just like them. Not all teachers are the my favourite teacher but all of them are really valueble and kind teachers. In my opinion a teacher has an ability to support the student from the ground to the way to success. 
	So, lets talk about my mentor's character, I dont have any words to describe her impressive and brave personality but I can discuss some of them. A kind and sweet hearted person who knows exactly how to deal with student with different mentality. She can read that what's going on in the mind. The most special thing I like is her patience. She is the first girl I see who has patience who can adjust in any situation	
	The reason that why she becames my dearest teacher because of her dynamic and motivated words towards every student. If a person is going to give up, just because of her tone he/she can't give up easily. It's the first time after my hifz teacher she is my favorite. The second unique quality is that she can break complex tasks and concepts into simple and easier format that. 
	Further more, Its not possible for me to wake up early in the morning even with 4 to 6 alarms rings, but since she helped me to wake up earlier by continously calling on the phone. I used to revise important concepts, but Alhamdulillah I have started praying Fajr with Imam and InshaAllah in future I will not forget to pray morning devotion. From her companionship I have learn not to be abusive and disrespectful towards everyone specially women because we have forgotten the respect to women that our prophet Muhammad SAW told us. Instead of thinking bad about someone, be polite and well behaved.
	In conclusion, a best teacher and favourite teacher of a student is that who understands their learner and treat according to the leaner's behavior because our religion ranked teachers before parents. Treat them just like you do with your parents.

Compose an essay about your future. In your essay, describe
- how you think your future would look like.
- TWO things you would like to keep hold of in the future.
- a reason for each thing.

I don't know how my future will looks like. But I can imagine it. My father says to me that always think bigger. If you wants ferrari, wish to have helicopter. We can think as much we can, but visualizing without hardwork and prayers will be regretful and waste of time. I want to be a successful person in my life to enjoy every moment of life with my parents. To acheive these all I will be rearly working on IT sector and business mind.
	Eventually I am currently grabing skills on modren web development field and seeking command in python for the rising Agentic AI future. I have learn intermediate python and after that I will begin to learn advance python. As per OpenAI previuos report a developer with expertise in LLM (Large language model) can make up to $56,000 dollar per year. 
	Moreover, I have a clear and sharp business ideas. I don't like 9 to 5 jobs in which manager gives a stressful workload to the employee like that they are giving 1 thousand dollars to them. Its better to start with a business. It sounds like easy,  but in actual it requires pateince, emotions and future strategic planning about the market requires a capital to invest. Before turning 18, I will find the the work to start saving money. and invest in Halal Stock. I have followed social media influencers who trade and guide that how to start. 
	Strick planning and consistent focus can lead to the process of perfection. Listening to the successful person's biography and business podcasts as well as building soft skills which will help me reach the market. In todays real world success is not just about money, it is the peace that everybody needs in their lives.

Dear Marjan Alam,
	I am fine also. I got your previous letter. Initially I was shock that you are trying to find part-time job just for an extra pocket money. You are a person who only knows when and where to sleep and now you are hunting a job. Seriously I was shocked.
	But no problem, I know that you are very talented and curios about your future but you dont show it. You told me that you have learnt lots of technologies with respect to block chain development. You are very sharp. Market demands web development but you choose blockchain as your skills. Nice option. Because unique tools and niche will be unique at a time and there is a massive competition in it, while block chain and other niches are not in demand but have less competition. 
	First of all, you have to make an ATS friendly resume to showcase your fascinating projects, as you are in the feild of Information Technology, you should have your own personal portfolio that is essential tool for every developer in the market. Try not to make projects like voting app, blog app or ecommerce website because nowadays everybody has these common projects in their resume. Clients need solution based on the problem that how you think, analyze and create the solution. That's the key point every reqruiter will see. 
	Secondly, start connecting to the tech world people in order to get jobs or placements. the more you connect, the more you got opportunities. You can get global connections by various sites but I will recommend you to use LinkedIn. Create LinkedIn profile and edit it according to the inputs. Consistently Post your every recent projects on it so everyone will try to connect you and you will be noticed be by others. Search the jobs and send you work.
	Last but not the least, you can create an account on freelancing platforms like Fiverr, Upwork or Toptal. (US based companies) or you can apply for the nearby software house as a blockchain developer. 
	Don't wait, just start. If you need more elements regarding job hunting please tell me. Say Salam to You family and give lots of love to your younger siblings. Hoping for your job acceptance for any giant tech company. 



Your sinceirly,
Marjan Ahmed.
